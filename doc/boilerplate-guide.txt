# Boilerplate Guide for Project Boilerplates

Welcome to the Boilerplate Guide for the project-boilerplates repository, created for the HashSlap Summer of Code (HSSoC) on June 16, 2025! This guide will help you use the existing boilerplates to start your projects and show you how to add new boilerplates to share with the community. Itâ€™s designed for beginners, so donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re new to coding or Gitâ€”weâ€™re here to help you learn!

## What Are Boilerplates?

Boilerplates are pre-made project templates that give you a starting point for building apps. Instead of setting up a project from scratch, you can use these templates to quickly start coding. This repository includes boilerplates for:
- HTML/CSS (for simple web pages)
- Node.js (for JavaScript server apps)
- Flask (for Python web apps)
- Django (for Python web frameworks)
- React (for JavaScript front-end apps)

Each boilerplate comes with the basic files and structure you need to get started.

## How to Use an Existing Boilerplate

Follow these steps to use a boilerplate from this repository:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Clone the repo by running:
  git clone https://github.com/HashSlap-Summer-of-Code/project-boilerplates.git
- Navigate to the project folder:
  cd project-boilerplates

### Step 2: Choose a Boilerplate
- Go to the `boilerplates/` directory to see all available templates:
  - `boilerplates/html-css/` for a simple web page
  - `boilerplates/nodejs/` for a Node.js server
  - `boilerplates/flask/` for a Flask app
  - `boilerplates/django/` for a Django project
  - `boilerplates/react/` for a React app

### Step 3: Set Up the Boilerplate
Each boilerplate has its own setup steps. Here are examples for a few:

#### HTML/CSS Boilerplate
- Navigate to the folder:
  cd boilerplates/html-css
- Open `index.html` in a browser to see the basic webpage.
- Edit `index.html` and `style.css` to customize your page.

#### Flask Boilerplate
- Navigate to the folder:
  cd boilerplates/flask
- Install dependencies (youâ€™ll need Python installed):
  pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the app:
  python app.py
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to see the app.

#### React Boilerplate
- Navigate to the folder:
  cd boilerplates/react
- Install dependencies (youâ€™ll need Node.js installed):
  npm install
- Start the app:
  npm start
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the React app.

For other boilerplates, check if thereâ€™s a `README.txt` in the folder with specific instructions. If not, follow similar steps based on the technology (e.g., Node.js uses `npm`, Django uses `pip`).

### Step 4: Start Building!
- Use the boilerplate as a starting point for your project.
- Add your own features, like new pages, styles, or functionality.
- If you get stuck, check the `CONTRIBUTING.txt` file or open an issue on GitHub for help.

## How to Add a New Boilerplate

Want to share a new boilerplate with the community? Hereâ€™s how to contribute one:

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository
- Fork the repository on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button.
- Clone your fork to your computer:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-boilerplates.git
  cd project-boilerplates

### Step 2: Create a New Boilerplate Folder
- Go to the `boilerplates/` directory.
- Create a new folder for your boilerplate, named after the technology (e.g., `boilerplates/python/`, `boilerplates/vue/`).
- Add the necessary files for your boilerplate. For example:
  - For a Python boilerplate:
    - Create `boilerplates/python/main.py` with a simple script (e.g., print("Hello, World!")).
    - Add a `boilerplates/python/README.txt` with setup instructions (e.g., "Run with: python main.py").
  - For a Vue.js boilerplate:
    - Create `boilerplates/vue/` with the basic Vue project structure (`src/`, `package.json`, etc.).
    - Add a `boilerplates/vue/README.txt` with setup instructions (e.g., "Run: npm install && npm run serve").

### Step 3: Test Your Boilerplate
- Make sure your boilerplate works by following your own setup instructions.
- Test it on your computer to ensure everything runs smoothly.

### Step 4: Submit Your Contribution
- Stage and commit your changes:
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add Python boilerplate"
- Push your changes to your fork:
  git push origin main
- Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub:
  - Go to your fork on GitHub.
  - Click "Pull Request" and follow the steps to submit your PR.
- In your PR description, explain what your boilerplate does and how to use it.

### Tips for Adding Boilerplates
- Keep it simpleâ€”boilerplates should be minimal and easy for beginners to understand.
- Include a `README.txt` in your boilerplate folder with clear setup instructions.
- Test your boilerplate thoroughly before submitting.
- Check the `CONTRIBUTING.txt` file for more guidelines.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Dependencies Not Installing?** Make sure you have the required software installed (e.g., Python for Flask/Django, Node.js for React/Node.js). Check your internet connection, and try running the install command again.
- **App Not Running?** Double-check the setup steps in the boilerplate folder. Look for error messages in the terminalâ€”they often give clues about whatâ€™s wrong.
- **Not Sure Where to Start?** Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `beginner` on GitHub. These are designed for new contributors like you!

## Need Help?

If you have questions or run into issues:
- Open an issue on GitHub with details about your problem.
- Mention what youâ€™re trying to do (e.g., "Iâ€™m trying to use the Flask boilerplate, but I get an error when running python app.py").
- The HSSoC community is here to support you, so donâ€™t hesitate to ask!
